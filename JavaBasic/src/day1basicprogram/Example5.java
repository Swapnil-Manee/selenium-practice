/**
{
	//body ---> if its belongs to class dn class body
				if its belongs to method dn method body
}

class contains statements ---> statements are variables & methods
						  ---> they are made of keyword, Identifier & Literal

Steps to write first java programs:
1. open edit plus --> file -->new --> java
2. Give some class name like "Example1"
3. to save file, ---> file --> new-->save (ctrl+s)
4. use double quates and give file name as classname with .java extension 
		like ---> "Example1.java"
5. to compile java program, first open command prompt(windows key + r ---> serach for cmd)
6. in command prompt goto the location where you have saved your program
		//or instead of step 5 & 6 Use this
	goto the location where you have saved you program and in the path section type cmd and press enter key
7. now you are allowed to complie java program, use below syntax to compile java program
		"javac filename.java"
	after successfull compilation java will generate .class filename in the same location
	where .java file is stored
8. now we can execute java program, use below syntax to execute
		"java classfilename"

9. after every change in .java file, we should compile program again in order to get update result

10. while compilation if we get any error dn we won't be able to generate .class file
11. java is a case sensitive programming language
12. we can write anything inside double quates of println("")
		System.out.println("123456789!@#$%^&*(ASDFGHJKwertyui");
